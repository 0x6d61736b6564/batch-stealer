Hi I make my batch files in this repository

# QUESTIONS

- What is the batch ?
The term batch designates in computer science the automation of a series of commands executed in series on a computer without the need for an operator to intervene to carry out this operation.
It is translated most of the time by the term "lot" in French and by the expression "processing by lots".
Batch processing is most often used to automate certain tasks such as account management, or planned shutdown of computers,
especially in the world of companies that have a large computer base. The technique of batch processing is then opposed to interactive or transactional programs.
The term can be used to differentiate it from real-time processing

- Why the batch?
the batch has been criticized but in "good hands" it can be very powerful

- Wow can i run a .bat?
on your windows pc edit the batch file and double click on it

- What are the risks?
if you do not check the code a batch could destroy your pc or steal your personal information (passwords etc...)
